      <p>During my time as a <strong>Research and Teaching Assistant</strong> at <strong>Yildiz Technical University</strong> (2022–2025), I supported several core courses and led various laboratory sessions within the Department of Control and Automation Engineering.</p>

      <h3>Teaching Assistantship (TA)</h3>
      <p>In this role, I assisted professors in course delivery and conducting problem-solving sessions for the following undergraduate courses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>System Dynamics, Modeling and Simulation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Process Control</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Signals and Systems, Their Applications in Control Engineering</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Control Systems</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Laboratory Instruction</h3>
      <p>I was responsible for leading hands-on laboratory sessions, where I guided students through experimental setups, data acquisition, and technical reporting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial Automation Systems Laboratory</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Electronic Circuits and Measurement Laboratory</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Control Laboratory</strong></li>
      </ul>
